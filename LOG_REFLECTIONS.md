# Log Reflections

> How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?

The logs differed in how they were hosted (Google Sites, Github-hosted Markdown files, Google Docs). I noticed that although all logs were mostly weekly goals followed descriptions on what was done on a day-to-day basis, some seemed to add additional daily goals or things they wanted to accomplish for the day which I thought was interesting. I also thought it was interesting how the entries seemed to be ordered in reverse chronological order.

In terms of writing styles, although all used bullet points, some were more brief and just listed a summary of what happened on a day to day basis whereas others went into more detail about the exact discussions they had about whatever point they were talking about.

> How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?

For the researcher, it could really help them track when they got certain parts of the research done, and by chronicling their thought process for their decisions, it can help them justify the decisions they made later on if they forget.

For those working with the researcher, it helps give them insight into what the research is struggling on/accomplishing, which can help them coordinate and make more informed decisions on what steps to take next.

> Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?

They did seem to meet their goals better over time.
