- Lab is good
- Professors are reputable and helpful

Hardest part?

- University
- In CS

Is graduate school what you thought it would be like? What is it like? What did you expect? How are these the same/different?
- Less connection to practical world, more problem solving
- Not really useful

Who's your advisor & how are they?
- Very nice people

## Reflection

I was surprised about how little stress Ishtiyaque seemed to be under. Although I knew there was freedom associated with research, I thought that there would be
a lot of pressure to perform and produce results. It seemed like some of the other grad students in the DSL said that they had more stress, so I guess it's 
more subjective and maybe it's more being able to choose how much stress you're under. I really related a lot to Ishtiyaque when he described what made research
so appealing; the idea of creating something new rather than assembling products from existing code seems really intriguing to me, and even though I plan on going
into industry soon, I think I want to pursue research further down the line for this reason. Grad student life seems a lot more nebulous than I thought; I thought that
problems would come by easily, but I guess it's a lot more difficult to narrow down on and find a problem in the first place.
