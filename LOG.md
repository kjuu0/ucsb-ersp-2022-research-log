### Accomplishments

#### Tuesday, 09/28 (2 hours)

- Set up research log. Chose to use Github Markdown because I'm a fan of the aesthetics/formatting and it makes linking other documents in the same repo easy.
- Finished Reflection 1.
- Finished reading & [reflecting on the research logs.](/LOG_REFLECTIONS.md)
- Finalized a meeting time for the team on Slack for Thursday 4-5 PM.
- I'm most excited about:
  - Meeting my team/professors
  - Stepping out of my comfort zone
  - Doing research on distributed systems
- I'm most nervous about:
  - Keeping up with my teammates
  - Balancing my schedule
